# Shell Terminal Project
Make a shell terminal for CPSC 351 Assignment 14

# Currently Working
- Single commands are working
    - `ls`  
    - `pwd`  
- The '>' operator is working
    - Ex. `ls > output.txt`  
    - Ex.  `pwd > output.txt`  
- The '<' operator is also working
    - Ex. `wc < output.txt`
- Environment Variables are working  
    - Note: my replace_env_vars function is currently appending, I did not have enough time to fix it
- Pipe is not working right now


## BONUS
- Added current working directory to each line as you would see in a terminal
