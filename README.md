# Shell Terminal Project
For CPSC 351 Assignment 14

# Currently Working
- Single commands are working
    - `ls`  
    - `pwd`  
- The '>' operator is working
    - Ex. `ls > output.txt`  
    - Ex.  `pwd > output.txt`  
- The '<' operator is also working
    - Ex. `wc < output.txt`
- Still working on the environment variables


## BONUS
- Added current working directory to each line as you would see in a terminal
    - Extra credit for me?
