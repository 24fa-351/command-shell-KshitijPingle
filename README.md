# Shell Terminal Project
For CPSC 351 Assignment 14

# Currently Working
- Single commands are working
    - `ls`  
    - `pwd`  
- The '>' operator is working
    - Ex. `ls > output.txt`  
    - Ex.  `pwd > output.txt`  
- The '<' operator is also working
    - Ex. `wc < output.txt`

**NOTE:** The '<' '>' operators currently have a weird thing going on where they execute two times  
      Once in the file and again in the terminal. Don't know where it's happening yet.
